## What is Triathlon? 

Business Understanding: Giving context to our project (coding by Katharina Kre√ü)

In this part we wanted to give some insights about Triathlon itself.  
Our Datasets include information about events and athletes from 1983-2022.  
We wanted datadriven insights like growth of events & athletes, gender- and age-distribution over the time.

In this Folder are two Notebooks:

-  **01_clean_Triathlon_dataset** - checking NaN, duplicates, change datatypes, droping columns, first visualisation with geopandas
  
- **02_prep_Traithlon_dataset** - preparing for a tableau dashboard by adding new columns designed to become parameter
    - special_category like Pro & Para Athletes
    - distance like sprint or olympic
    - new age-classes
